# Code_Refactor

The purpose of this project is to fix a website that is not accessible to all end users, in addition to cleaning up some legacy code. The code ,while working for the most part, is not clean and has many duplicate css classes that cause confusion and slow down the ability to rapidly change information or format of the website.

I have documented the changes that I made in the update.txt file located in the root of this repository and added screenshots of the final product.
